# Titanic-Machine-Learning-from-Disaster

I participated in the Kaggle Titanic Machine Learning competition to predict passenger survival, where I utilized logistic regression modeling in Python. The model achieved a 76% accuracy rate, which, while decent, leaves room for improvement. Given more time, I would have experimented with additional models to enhance the accuracy further. This project helped me strengthen my skills in feature engineering, model evaluation, and parameter tuning within a time-constrained environment.
