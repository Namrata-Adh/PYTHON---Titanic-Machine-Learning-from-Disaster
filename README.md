# Titanic-Machine-Learning-from-Disaster

I participated in the Kaggle Titanic Machine Learning competition to predict passenger survival, where I utilized logistic regression modeling in Python. The model achieved a 76% accuracy rate, which, while decent, leaves room for improvement. Given more time, I would have experimented with additional models to enhance the accuracy further. This project helped me strengthen my skills in feature engineering, model evaluation, and parameter tuning within a time-constrained environment.


# About the Kaggle competition and dataset

The dataset used for this project is divided into two parts: a training set (train.csv) and a test set (test.csv). The training set is used to build and train the machine learning model, with the 'Survived' column provided as the ground truth outcome for each passenger. This allows the model to learn from various features such as passengers’ gender, class, and other attributes. Feature engineering techniques were also applied to create new variables and enhance the model's predictive ability.

The test set contains similar data without the 'Survived' outcome, which remains unknown. After training the model on the training set, I used it to predict survival outcomes for passengers in the test set, assessing the model’s performance on unseen data.
